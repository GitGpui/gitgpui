# Diff And Conflict Resolver Performance Design

## Implementation Progress

### Priority Status

- P0
  - ✅ Resolved output gutter virtualization (`uniform_list` + shared `conflict_resolved_preview_scroll`)
  - ✅ Render-time recomputation in conflict hot paths (two-way + three-way line/conflict maps precomputed in state; render/nav now use O(1) lookups)
  - 🔧 Conflict rows on canvas fast path (two-way + three-way resolver rows now on keyed canvas behind `GITGPUI_CONFLICT_CANVAS_ROWS`; compare rows remain on fallback)
- P1
  - ⬜ Syntax mode/language caching in conflict renderers
  - ⬜ Cache invalidation scope reduction (search typing + split resize)
- P2
  - ✅ Precomputed state usage improved (two-way row/conflict maps + three-way column line maps in state)

### Phase Status

- ✅ Phase 1 (3/3 complete: gutter virtualization + two-way/three-way conflict map precompute + render-time map/range rebuild removal)
- 🔧 Phase 2 (2/3 complete: two-way + three-way conflict resolver keyed canvas paths + fallback flag; compare rows pending)
- ⬜ Phase 3
- ⬜ Phase 4

### Benchmark Notes

- 2026-03-04 (`cargo bench -p gitgpui-ui-gpui --bench performance -- diff_scroll/style_window`)
  - before: `diff_scroll/style_window/200` = `2.1486 ms .. 2.1521 ms`
  - after: `diff_scroll/style_window/200` = `2.1730 ms .. 2.1811 ms`
  - note: criterion reported "Change within noise threshold" (estimated `+0.66% .. +1.02%`); this benchmark still does not isolate three-way conflict canvas row rendering directly.

## Context

Large diff and conflict-resolution screens are currently less responsive than Zed on big files. The worst UX issues are:

- choppy scroll in large conflict views
- sluggish search/filter interactions while conflict panes are open
- resize drag hitching in split conflict mode

This document describes what to fix, how to fix it, and where to gather more data.

## Target Performance

Use these targets for large conflict cases (10k+ lines, 300+ conflict blocks):

- 60 Hz goal: p95 frame time under 10 ms, p99 under 16.6 ms while scrolling
- input latency: search keystroke to painted update under 50 ms p95
- split-resize drag: no sustained frame spikes over 25 ms
- no full-list re-render work proportional to total file size during steady-state scroll

## Baseline Signals

Current benchmark coverage includes generic diff styling, not conflict-render paths:

- `cargo bench -p gitgpui-ui-gpui --bench performance -- diff_scroll/style_window`
- observed local baseline from this harness:
  - window 100: about 1.09 ms
  - window 200: about 2.19 ms
  - window 400: about 4.39 ms

Interpretation: core line styling scales roughly linearly and is not the largest bottleneck by itself. Conflict UI render/invalidation paths are likely the dominant jank source.

## Main Findings And Fixes

### P0: Resolved output gutter is not virtualized

Status: ✅ Implemented (iteration 1, 2026-03-04).

Historical evidence (before fix):

- `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/panels/main.rs:1894` computes `outline_len`
- `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/panels/main.rs:1896` calls `render_conflict_resolved_preview_rows(0..outline_len, ...)`
- `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/panels/main.rs:1951` renders all gutter rows as children

Impact:

- work scales with total line count, not visible window size
- large resolved outputs generate large element trees and expensive layout/paint

Fix:

- replace eager gutter row tree with `uniform_list` tied to `conflict_resolved_preview_scroll`
- render only visible gutter rows
- keep right-side text editor and gutter scroll fully synchronized
- optional follow-up: render gutter lane via canvas overlay in the editor viewport

Implementation anchors:

- render function: `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs:565`
- scroll handle state: `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/panes/main.rs:1553`

### P0: Render-time recomputation in hot paths

Status: ✅ Implemented (iteration 3, 2026-03-04): two-way and three-way row/line conflict mappings are precomputed in `ConflictResolverUiState` and reused by render/navigation.

Historical evidence (three-way, before iteration 3):

- `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs:85` calls `build_three_way_column_conflict_ranges(...)` inside render
- `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs:59` uses `position()` scan per line (`conflict_range_for_line`)
- `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs:288` to `:292` does repeated lookup per rendered row

Evidence (two-way, historical before iteration 2):

- `render_conflict_resolver_diff_rows` rebuilt row-to-conflict mappings during render
- two-way conflict navigation helpers rebuilt mappings while jumping/selecting conflicts
- both were derived data that already originate from marker segments

Impact:

- repeated O(rows * conflicts) work in scroll hot path
- avoidable CPU and allocator pressure

Fix:

- precompute once when conflict state changes, store in `ConflictResolverUiState`
- add direct line-to-conflict index maps for O(1) lookup in row rendering
- remove range-building and map-building from render methods

State integration anchors:

- state struct: `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/mod.rs:462`
- state build path: `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/panes/main.rs:3633` and `:3750`
- mapping helpers: `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/conflict_resolver.rs:997` and `:1062`

### P0: Conflict rows are not on the canvas fast path

Status: 🔧 Partially implemented (iteration 5, 2026-03-04): two-way and three-way conflict resolver rows now use keyed canvas via `rows/conflict_canvas.rs`, guarded by `GITGPUI_CONFLICT_CANVAS_ROWS` fallback (enabled by default). Conflict compare rows are still on the fallback renderer.

Evidence:

- conflict rows use `div` + `StyledText` through `conflict_diff_text_cell(...)`
- `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs:1440`

Contrast:

- normal diff rows use keyed canvas and explicit paint path
- `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/diff.rs:976`
- `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/diff_canvas.rs:25`

Impact:

- more element construction, layout, and text-node churn in large conflict views
- weaker control over paint cost and reuse

Fix:

- create `conflict_canvas.rs` and port conflict split/inline/three-way line rendering to keyed canvas
- preserve interactions via hitboxes (selection, context menus, hover state)
- keep current non-canvas renderer behind a temporary fallback flag until parity is verified

Implementation anchors (current partial state):

- canvas module: `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_canvas.rs`
- two-way + three-way resolver integration: `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs`
- fallback flag/state: `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/panes/main.rs`

### P1: Syntax mode and language resolution are too expensive in conflict renderers

Evidence:

- per-row language resolution in conflict compare/resolver rows:
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs:1007`
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs:1117`
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs:1336`
- conflict paths hard-code `DiffSyntaxMode::Auto` in many spots:
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs:1030`
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs:1144`
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/conflict_resolver.rs:1359`

Contrast:

- main diff renderer downgrades to `HeuristicOnly` for large line counts
- `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/mod.rs:4`
- `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/diff.rs:128`

Fix:

- cache syntax language once per conflict file in UI state
- pick syntax mode once per render batch based on total row count
- reuse main diff threshold strategy (`MAX_LINES_FOR_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHTING`)
- optional second stage: split syntax tokens from query highlights so query updates do not force full styled-text rebuild

### P1: Cache invalidation is broad and frequent

Evidence:

- on each diff search text change, multiple caches are fully cleared:
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/panes/main.rs:1785` to `:1789`
- during split resize drag, split conflict style cache is cleared each move:
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/panels/main.rs:1541` to `:1542`

Impact:

- frequent cache churn during typing and dragging
- user-visible stutter in already heavy views

Fix:

- split cache layers:
  - stable layer: syntax + structural word highlights
  - volatile layer: search query highlight overlay
- invalidate only volatile layer on each query keystroke
- for split resize, avoid full text-style cache clears; only invalidate geometry-dependent artifacts

### P2: Precomputed state is underused

Evidence:

- `ConflictResolverUiState` already stores precomputed visibility/ranges:
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/mod.rs:479`
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/mod.rs:487`
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/mod.rs:488`
  - `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/mod.rs:489`
- render still recomputes related structures (see P0 above)

Fix:

- extend state with missing render indices/maps
- treat render code as pure lookup + paint work

## Proposed Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 (High impact, low risk)

- virtualize resolved output gutter list
- precompute three-way and two-way conflict maps in sync path
- remove render-time `map_two_way_rows_to_conflicts` and `build_three_way_column_conflict_ranges`

Expected result: major scroll smoothness gain on large conflict files.

### Phase 2 (High impact, medium risk)

- add conflict canvas renderer for split and inline modes
- add three-way canvas renderer after split/inline parity
- keep non-canvas fallback while validating behavior

Expected result: lower layout overhead and tighter frame-time distribution.

### Phase 3 (Medium impact, low risk)

- apply syntax-mode gating and language caching to conflict renderers
- reduce cache invalidation scope for search and resize

Expected result: improved responsiveness during search typing and pane resizing.

### Phase 4 (Measurement and guardrails)

- add dedicated conflict benchmarks and tracing counters
- set performance budgets in CI reports (alerting first, hard fail later)

Expected result: prevent regressions and quantify gains per phase.

## Instrumentation Plan

Add lightweight timing around hot functions (debug/dev builds first):

- `render_conflict_resolver_three_way_rows`
- `render_conflict_resolver_diff_rows`
- `render_conflict_resolved_preview_rows`
- conflict cache build paths (`build_cached_diff_styled_text` call sites)
- `recompute_conflict_resolved_outline_and_provenance`

Track at least:

- rows requested vs rows actually painted
- cache hit/miss ratio by cache type
- time spent in syntax highlighting vs word/query highlighting
- per-frame time spent in conflict render functions

## Benchmark Plan

Extend existing benchmark harness:

- file: `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/src/view/rows/benchmarks.rs`
- entrypoint: `crates/gitgpui-ui-gpui/benches/performance.rs`

Add fixtures/benches:

- `conflict_three_way_scroll/window_{100,200,400}`
- `conflict_two_way_split_scroll/window_{100,200,400}`
- `conflict_resolved_output_gutter_scroll/window_{100,200,400}`
- `conflict_search_query_update` (simulate keystroke churn)
- `conflict_split_resize_step` (simulate drag updates)

Acceptance thresholds (initial):

- three-way scroll window 200: p95 under 8 ms
- split scroll window 200: p95 under 6 ms
- search update on large conflict: p95 under 40 ms

## Validation Checklist

- verify identical UI behavior for:
  - row selection
  - context menus
  - hide-resolved behavior
  - active conflict navigation
  - conflict pick actions
- verify no visual regressions in:
  - syntax colors
  - word highlights
  - query highlights
  - line numbers and badges
- compare before/after traces on same synthetic and real large conflicts

## Recommended First PR Scope

Keep first PR narrowly focused to de-risk:

1. Virtualize resolved-output gutter.
2. Move three-way and two-way conflict mapping out of render.
3. Add a benchmark for three-way conflict scroll.

Then measure and iterate before moving conflict rows to canvas.
